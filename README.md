Attitude determination and control system of a CubeSat <br>
This project was inspired by<a href="https://github.com/Stapelzeiger/adcs"> Stapelzeiger's repository</a> <br>
Attitude determination is provided by Extended Kalman Filter and Multiplicative Kalman Filter<br>

Attitude control algorithms - B-dot, LQR are available<br>
For live demostration run <b>main_simulation.m</b>. For deep precomputation run <b>main_figures</b><br>
